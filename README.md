### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ray and I write random things. Sometimes, if they're actually interesting, I'll put 'em on GitHub. Lately I have been looking towards game development and computer graphics without a pre-made engine (and other computer graphics-y stuff). My main project right now is [Lepton](https://github.com/ranchordo/lepton2), and I'm currently putting it to the test in some interesting ways.<br><br>

You can contact me via the following:
- Email: <a href="mailto:ranchordo@proton.me">ranchordo@proton.me</a>
- Discord: ranchordo

### Some random information
- I live in Colorado
- I'm currently an undergraduate student (until ~May 2026) at CU Boulder studying physics and applied mathematics
- I do research in optics (specifically the use of structured light in biomedical imaging)
- I'm a huge fan of computational neuroscience and annoying advocate for biologically plausible models
- I am entirely self-taught in terms of programming
- My pronouns: He/him
- I enjoy making stupid self-referential jokes in my readme
- I cannot fathom why anyone would have actually read to this point
