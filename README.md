### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ray and I write random things. Sometimes, if they're actually interesting, I'll put 'em on GitHub. Lately I have been looking towards game design without a pre-made engine, and I have some pretty epic game-related projects (unlike Boson-LWJGL, the total failure) that I am about to make public. So stay tuned!<br><br>

You can contact me via the following:
- Email: <a href="mailto:ranchordo@gmail.com">ranchordo@gmail.com</a>
- Discord: ranchordo#3689

### Some facts about me
- I live in Colorado
- I am entirely self-taught in terms of programming
- I don't write comments as much as I should because I think code should be able to describe itself
- My pronouns: He/him

### Some stats stuff, I guess?
